A pure-Python library that can read and write Password Safe v3 files has been released under the GPLv2 by Symantec. Attached is a copy of the latest code. 

Id like to either host this as a sub-project out of the Password Safe project or create a new SourceForge/Google Code project for this library. Thoughts? 

There are a few known issues: 

1) HMAC validation fails with some recent versions of Password Safe. I suspect this is an issue with the support for bug 1812081. 
2) Some of the more recent record properties arent supported
3) Lack of documentation

I intend to update the library to correct these issues as time allows. 

I can be reached with any thoughts, ideas, or concerns via paul at gpmidi net.
