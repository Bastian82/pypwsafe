A pure-Python library that can read and write Password Safe v3 files has been released under the GPLv2 by Symantec. 



There are a few known issues: 

1) HMAC validation fails with some recent versions of Password Safe. I suspect this is an issue with the support for bug 1812081. 
2) Some of the more recent record properties aren't supported
3) Lack of documentation
4) Unit tests are out-of-date
5) Need to add an install script

Deps: 
1) python-mcrypt
2) hashlib

	yum install libmcrypt-devel libmcrypt
