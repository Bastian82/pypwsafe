A pure-Python library that can read and write Password Safe v3 files. The library was initially released by Symantec under the GPLv2 in 2011. 

There are a few known issues: 
	1) Lack of documentation
	2) Unit tests are out-of-date
	3) There MAY be an issue with the order that NonDefaultPrefsHeader serializes preferences for HMAC validation in pypwsafe. Although the library validates HMACs fine at the moment, so who knows. 
	4) The version of python-mcrypt for Windows isn't compatible with this library. As a result, the pypwsafe library doesn't work in Windows. If anyone is able to get around this, please notify us. The library has not been tried under Cygwin.    
	 
Dependencies: 
	1) python-mcrypt
	2) hashlib OR pycrypto

RHEL/CentOS Install Instructions
	1) Install libmcrypt and it's dev package along with the Python dev package: 
		yum install libmcrypt-devel libmcrypt python-devel
		These packages are needed by the installer for python-mcrypt
	2) Install the standard Linux development tools. For RHEL/CentOS 5 and 6, `yum groupinstall 'Development tools'` can be used if your YUM repos have group information. 
	3) Use Pip or easy install to install python-mcrypt, hashlib, and pycrypto
	4) Run the setup script
		python setup.py install
	5) Test that the module loads
		python -c "import pypwsafe"

FAQ
	Q: Why mcrypt and not use pyCrypto?
	A: The pyCrypto library doesn't support TwoFish, which is a newer cipher based on Blowfish. Twofish is required to encrypt/decrypt Password Safe v3 files.  

	Q: Where can I find details on the Password Safe file format?
	A: http://passwordsafe.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=passwordsafe/pwsafe.git;a=blob_plain;f=pwsafe/pwsafe/docs/formatV3.txt;hb=HEAD or go to the password safe code base and check in /pwsafe/pwsafe/docs/formatV3.txt. 
	
TODO
	1) Add support for using a pure-python TwoFish algorithm if mcrypt doesn't work.
	   a) http://code.google.com/p/python-keysafe/source/browse/crypto/twofish.py
	   b) http://www.bjrn.se/code/twofishpy.txt 
	2) Need to update against the latest version of the official psafe format v3 doc.
